# falconCRM
Falcon is a management system mobile application for service provider shops
that enables them to record customer data through QR codes generated from
their customer accounts. It also provides insights about data statistics through
reporting and analysis. From a customerâ€™s perspective, Falcon is also a tracking
system that allows users to keep their eyes on their requested service. Falcon facilitates
communication between customers and service providers through a chat
panel. Our application supports a loyalty marketing strategy by creating vouchers
that offer discounts to customers after they accumulate a specific amount of
points from their previous orders, encouraging them to continue doing business
with the same service provider.

#Flutter
The application was built using flutter and dart.
The database was a noSQL database using Google's Firebase.
